# FastApi
Application of filters on image  in jupytar and through FastApi

We have applied the filters in jupytae file. For understanding the use of FastApi , i applied the image filters in Virtual Environment (VSCode).
main.py is file and image filtering functions are written in  functions.py file. 

First we will install VScode and will open the folder in VScode , then through terminal will write the command 

                              python -m uvicorn main:app --reload 

It will give IP address and run that address in the browser. Page will open where we will upload image and filtered image will come in our directory. As virtual environment 

We have also applied the same functions in single  jupytar file image & image filtering types .
